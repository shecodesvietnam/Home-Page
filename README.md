## Introduction
SheCodes's signature event is a women hackathon that aims to encourage more women
getting involved in STEM. SheCodes' mission is to gradually close the gender gap in
Vietnam's IT industry. In SheCodes, women are encouraged to come together and use
technology to transform ideas into reality & build a community to support each other in
their way of learning more about technology.
